Remix Icon For Vue3

Remix Icon is a set of open-source neutral-style system symbols for designers and developers. Unlike a patchwork icon library, 2600+ icons are all elaborately crafted so that they are born with the gene of readability, consistency and perfect pixels. Each icon was designed in "Outlined" and "Filled" styles based on a 24x24 grid. Of course, all the icons are free for both personal and commercial use.
